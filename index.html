            question: "Why did you pick Ferris?",
            answer: "Originally from Sao-Paulo, Brazil, I first came to Ferris as an International Student to study English for one year, but I quickly realized that Ferris was a great fit for me.  I loved campus life and campus events, found my fit and made friends through the Student Organizations and Athletic Events, and learned that I could succeed academically here through all the resources available to students, such as our SLA program, tutoring center and career counseling.  I am happy to say now that Ferris has been my home for the last 8 years.  I love working with students and their families, and helping them take their first steps towards a college degree and their career goals."
